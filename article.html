        <p class="article-text">&emsp;&emsp;Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances
             between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence.
             However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.
            The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep" machine learning can use
             labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled 
             dataset. The deep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically
              determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human
             intervention required and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" 
             as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides outside ibm.com)1. <br />
             <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;Classical, or "non-deep," machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of 
            features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.
            Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more 
            hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. 
            If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of
             the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep learning is just referring
              to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input 
              and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network.
            Deep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
